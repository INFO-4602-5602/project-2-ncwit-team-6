# visualization 1 (Josiah):
- grid of circles
    - circle = school
    - two colors in circle
    - colors represent gender
    - interactive:
        - user can control year
        - year will move automatically

# visualization 2 (Hunter):
This visualization shows how the percentage of women in a given major changed over time. 

My design process for this visualization started with the simplest question someone might want to know: how has the percentage of women in STEM majors changed over time? I then thought it would be interesting to split this up by major. However, when I did this, I found that there were too many majors for any really sensical plot to be meaningful, so I limited the set of majors I was looking at to those which had more than 10 years of data, so the user could really see trends.

The visualization is titled "Percentage of Women in different majors over time".

# visualization 3 (Brian):
- look at single institution
    - compare institutions?
    - look at single class (i.e., stats years 2011-2015)
