# Team 6:
- Josiah Buxton
- Brian Lubars
- Kenneth (Hunter) Wapman
- Christopher Godley

# visualization 1 (Josiah):
- grid of circles
    - circle = school
    - two colors in circle
    - colors represent gender
    - interactive:
        - user can control year
        - year will move automatically

# visualization 2 (Hunter):
- change in percentage of gender as over time
    - maybe: can choose ethnicity?
        - or plot multiple
    - maybe: filter by major?

# visualization 3 (Brian):
- look at single institution
    - compare institutions?
    - look at single class (i.e., stats years 2011-2015)
